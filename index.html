    <h2 class="significance">Significance and Legacy</h2>
    <p>Paul Walker was an American actor who prominently starred in the Fast and Furious francise. He died in a car accident in 2013. To many, he was only a famous individual who met a misfortunate end, but to many others he was much more. For me, he was someone I grew up with and gave me something to be excited about.</p>
    
    <p>I still remember going to watch the first Fast and Furious movie when it came out with my friends during high school. Walking out of the theatre, I still felt pulled into that world. The movie -- especially Paul's in-movie interest in cars -- was what piqued my interest in cars for the next few years, and knowingly for many others. During that period of my life, all I could think about was how I could earn enough money from working summers jobs to buy myself a Lancer Evolution. I remember going so far as to actually drive to the local dealership to ogle at the showroom cars. Of course, it was all a phase of an impressionable adolescent male. As the years drifted by, I recall that while each subsequent sequel was still great, they weren't gravitationally mezmorizing anymore. I no longer watched the movies for my interest in cars, but enjoyed each installment for nostalgia-sake. On a profound level, I enjoyed each film as I was able to see Paul's in-movie life unfold over the years. Despite it being acting, I still felt as though he was personally sharing his life with me as a close friend.</p>
    
    <p>There's something paradoxically indelible about a person's life and legacy if such an individual is someone we have come to know and has died prematurely. Such individuals live on in an immortalized form, honored in our memories by never aging while we ourselves still do. Perhaps the effect is the result of our mind's method of paying respect. If so, then it is the least we can do for such individuals.</p>
